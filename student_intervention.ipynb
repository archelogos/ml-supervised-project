In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "1. Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes algorithm is simple, fast, efficient and works great with small training sets (high-bias expected). However it is usually outperformed by other algorithms. NB assumes independent features but in this case they are not because for example sex_M and sex_F are clearly dependent.\n",
    "Even if this assumption is not true, NB still performs well in practice.\n",
    "Because of our training set isn't too large (300 samples) it seems reasonable to try a simple and efficient algorithm first (Occam's razor).\n",
    "NB is widely used in spam detection problems.\n",

    "2. Random Forest: Decision Tree Algorithm is also a good choice because our dataset isn't very large so that huge trees can be avoided. Instead of using a Decision Tree algorithm I prefer to try a Random Forest model in this case. \n",
    "Theoretically, Random Forest classifiers have the advantages of Decision Trees (easy to interpret and explain, non-parametric, robust to outliers) but also are more scalable. Besides RF are harder to overfit and easier to tune.\n",
    "Random forest Model is usually used for categorization of text documents.\n",
    "\n",

    "--: Complexity, it is necessary to be careful with dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Gradient Boosting Classifier: Boosting methods iterate N times over the training set to make better predictions based on these N estimations. In theory \"boosting is better\" because the model can learn \"more\" from the data. Higher resources consumption is expected in terms of computation. Recently, gradient boosting has gained some popularity in the field of learning to rank. Commercial web search engines such as Yahoo and Yandex use variants of gradient boosting in their machine-learned ranking engines.\n",

In addition, some of the features are just \"dummy features\" with 2 possible values so in these situations ensemble methods work great.**)\n"

    "For example, if we have 4 estimations of a particular datapoint, 3 label_a and 1 label_b, the final output could be label_a because 3 of the 4 learners have predicted label_a. In general these algorithms are more complex and the individual outputs are weighted. Besides that, a particular weak estimator (i) focuses more on datapoints that weren't properly classified by the previous estimator (i-1)\n",
